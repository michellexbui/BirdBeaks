# BirdBeaks

A package for interpolating magnetic field data across CONUS to explore
potential effects on migrating birds. 

Magnetic field data was accessed through SuperMag, a global database of ground-based magnetometer data hosted by JHU Applied Physics Laboratory.

# Bird Migrational Patterns and Their Relation to Magnetic Field Fluctuations

Birds are commonly known to have an internal magnetic compass to direct their  migrations. 
Currently, studies seek to observe exactly which aspects of avian anatomy contribute to a birdâ€™s magnetic compass.
The cranial anatomy of a bird contains several elements of magnetoreception. A study in 2010 showed a high frequency of an iron mineral containing sensory dendrites in the dermal lining of many bird beaks [1]. 
The iron mineral has been hypothesized as a potential sensory basis for magnetically dependent behavior. Since this is in the lining of many bird beaks, the growth of bird beaks can be attributed to greater surface area of the iron mineral. Variances in surface area of iron could increase sensitivity to fluctuations in magnetic field. Another aspect involving magnetodetection is the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, which is commonly located in the upper beak of birds. This feature has been recorded for sensitivities to magnetic field changes of at most 200 nT [2].
